Patricia Lago is the recipient of the ‘degree of doctor honoris causa’ at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), the top-ranked technology university in Norway.

The Board of NTNU has decided to award Patricia Lago an honorary doctorate, in recognition of her significant scientific contributions to digital transformation and the development of more sustainable software.

Lago has brought sustainability to the international software architecture community and has been a key driver for its establishment in the international software engineering community, too. She has contributed to the definition of various education programs and designed two master programs educating a new generation of software professionals combining software engineering with sustainability-related competences.

Lago’s academic contributions to the computer science research community over the years, are greatly appreciated by the NTNU faculty at the Department of Computer Science. In addition, she has been an inspiration to many young researchers as a female role model in an otherwise male dominated field.

The award ceremonies are scheduled on 17-18 November 2022.
