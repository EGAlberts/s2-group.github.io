The **Green Lab** is our ongoing research effort on software energy efficiency and other software qualities, such as performance, maintainability, etc.
In the video below you can get an idea about our activities around the Green Lab, enjoy!

The slides used in the video are also available in [this Slideshare deck](https://www.slideshare.net/iivanoo/the-green-lab-research-cocktail-vrije-universiteit-amsterdam-october-2020).

In a nutshell, the Green Lab is composed of three main components:
- The Green Lab is a **Master course** in the [Software Engineering and Green IT](https://vuweb.vu.nl/en/education/master/computer-science/curriculum?specialization=software-engineering-and-green-it) program of the Computer Science master of the VU. The course takes place every year in Period 1 (September-October) and it aims at teaching students the fundamentals of Empirical Software Engineering in the context of energy efficiency. The slides we used in 2016 edition of the Green Lab course are available [here](http://www.s2group.cs.vu.nl/2016/11/greenlabslides), give a look to them for understanding how we (and you!) can measure software for making it more green and sustainable!

- The Green Lab is also a **research laboratory**, currently located in the 7th floor of the NU building at the VU. The lab hosts a number of servers and a test farm composed of several Android mobile devices, instrumented with state-of-the-Art energy sensors, to run our experiments on software energy efficiency. In [this GitHub page](https://github.com/S2-group) we make publicly available all the experimental data we gather in the Green Lab. Stay tuned for new experiments!

- The Green Lab is also a **collaboration platform** with companies and other institutes (see here [our brochure](/assets/files/GreenLabBrochure.pdf) about how we can collaborate together). Starting from a *technological dilemma* proposed by our partners, together we undertake a well-defined, robust, and predictable exploration for solving it. As shown in the image below, we organize brainstorming sessions, produce preliminary designs of the experiment, evaluate technical alternatives, up to the delivery of a final comprehensive report with detailed results about the collected measures, and support our partners in the final phase of decision making.
