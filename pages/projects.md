# Ongoing projects
**Green Tactics for Robotics Software**<br>
The project allows roboticists to design energy-efficient robotics software via experimentally-validated Green tactics. Green tactics are extracted by mining millions of lines of code of real-world robotics software. The grant is offered in the context of the NWO Open Competition Domain Science – XS scheme.

**Green Lab**<br>
The S2 research group designs and conducts empirical experiments for solving what we call “industrial technological dilemmas” so to leverage companies from the burden of spending time and resources on risky technical choices, lengthy side-projects, and waste of resources.[Read more.](https://www.s2group.cs.vu.nl/files/GreenLabBrochure.pdf)

**Lower Energy Acceleration Program (LEAP)**<br>
This project aims to define the strategic roadmap for the Metropolitan Region Amsterdam, to invest in energy-efficient solutions for the future data infrastructures. The roadmap horizon of this specific project will be for the next 4-6 years (Horizon 2). It is part of the [LEAP (Lower Energy Acceleration Program)](https://amsterdameconomicboard.com/en/initiatief/leap-lower-energy-acceleration-program#) of the [Amsterdam Economic Board](https://amsterdameconomicboard.com/en/who-are-we). In LEAP track 2, we will contribute to a complete roadmap for the short, mid, and long term investments nationwide.

# Past projects
**NESSI**<br>
NESSI, the Networked European Software and Services Initiative, provides input to the EU Institutions on research actions and technology matters of particular importance to the software domain, and the overall aim is to enable the software and services sector help vitalize the great potential of the European economy and society.[Read more.](http://www.nessi-europe.com/)

**S-Cube**<br>
S-Cube, the European Network of Excellence in Software Services and Systems, has established an integrated, multidisciplinary, vibrant research community, enabling Europe to lead the software-services revolution and helping shape the software-service based Internet which is the backbone of our future interactive society.

**Griffin**<br>
The GRIFFIN project develops notations, tools and associated methods to extract, represent and use architectural knowledge that currently is not documented or represented in the system. GRIFFIN is a joint research project of the VU University Amsterdam and the University of Groningen. [Read more.](http://www.cs.rug.nl/paris/papers/AKM09a.pdf)

**CALCE**<br>
CALCE is a so called ICT-Doorbraak project, subsidized by the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs via Senter. The project code is TSIT3018, the other members of the consortium are: Getronics PinkRoccade, the Software Improvement Group of the VU, and the Dutch Centre for Mathematics and Computer Science (CWI). The goal of the project is to develop technology and methods, such that: (i) Software assets (which may be known as legacy) can be modernized according to the current needs of the organization in relation with modern software technologies and architectures; and (ii) the proces of software maintenance can turned from a labor intensive ad-hoc proces into an efficient high-tech one.

**SQUA3RE**<br>
Architecture reconstruction is the process by which architectural views of an implemented system are obtained from existing artifacts. While previous work investigated recovery techniques, such as clustering and pattern matching, this work provides research on architecture reconstruction that is driven by quality attribute analysis. The analysis typically occurs when existing systems hit their architectural boundaries caused by product growth or expansion scenarios. The information gathered during architecture reconstruction has to satisfy the information needs for these scenarios in order to provide reasoning during decision-making processes. The work is crucial for organizations that have to make architectural decisions about existing systems, or want to lower the adoption barriers for product lines by investigating the reuse of existing assets.
